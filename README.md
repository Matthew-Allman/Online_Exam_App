This Java-based application validates user credentials from the database and provides three subject-specific tests. Each test comprises five randomly generated questions with four answer choices for the user to select. Real-time feedback is provided, and the user receives a performance report after the test.

 * ## Problem Defined:
 *
 * As schools are online again, students and teachers must be ready to teach and learn in isolated environments. 
 * There is thus a need for activities students can do to break the monotony of the lockdown. Such a fun activity 
 * could doubly serve as a learning tool as well. The principal of Bramalea Secondary School, Mr. Kidd, has 
 * assigned the students in Ms. Barringâ€™s grade 12 Computer Science (ICS4U0) class, the educational task of 
 * creating an educational game that students can play on their devices at home. It is hoped that this will 
 * help with the monotony of students switching to online learning. 
 *
 * ## Purpose:
 *
 * To address the needs of Mr. Kidd, I have created a GUI (Graphical User Interface) Trivia Gaming application that will:
 *    * First allow the student to be verified by logging into the App.
 *    * The initial window will be this Login window that will allow the user to enter their name and student number.
 *    * After their entered information has been verified, the program will prompt the user to choose a grade 12 course.
 *    * Three courses will be available to the user to take the trivia quiz on.
 *    * Once the student has chosen their course, the application will display a second window.
 *    * Trivia questions on general content from this course will be presented to the user in a multiple choice format.
 *    * Each question will have a choice of four possible answers. 
 *    * It should allow the user to choose whichever option of subject they wish to answer trivia questions on. 
 *    * The student should be able to click whichever answer they feel is correct. 
 *    * If the answer they choose was wrong, the application will indicate a wrong answer.
 *    * If the answer is correct, it will indicate a correct answer.
 *    * It will then allow the user to go to the next question by a "Next Question" button. 
 *    * There will be 5 multiple-choice questions for each quiz. 
 *    * At the end of the quiz, the program should give the student their scores.
